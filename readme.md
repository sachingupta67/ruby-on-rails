# Ruby vs Ruby on Rails

## Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language designed for simplicity and productivity. It's a general-purpose language that can be used for various types of programming.

### Interactive Ruby Terminal (IRB)
- Type `irb` in your terminal to start the interactive Ruby shell
- This gives you a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment to experiment with Ruby code
- Type `exit` or press Ctrl+D to exit IRB
- Great for testing small code snippets and learning Ruby syntax

## Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails (or Rails) is a web application framework written in Ruby. Key differences from Ruby:
- Rails is built on top of Ruby - it uses Ruby as its programming language
- Rails follows "Convention over Configuration" principle for rapid web development
- Rails provides built-in support for:
  - Database management (Active Record)
  - RESTful web services
  - MVC architecture
  - Testing frameworks
  - Asset management
  - Security features

While Ruby is the programming language, Rails is a full-featured framework for building web applications using Ruby.
